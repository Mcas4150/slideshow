## Design Decisions

I wanted the design of this project to be simple yet attention-grabbing. The color palette was inspired by military grey and warning labels, colors which for some reason appeal to me. I added some slight animation to the buttons, and made the project mobile-friendly

## Development Decisions

The biggest decision of this project by far was deciding to keep it written in ReactJS. Although the prompt clearly states to avoid any use of libraries, I felt that given the time constraints and the desire to deliver the best possible example of my abilities, I chose to stick with the workflow and framework I know best. However, I believe the relative simplicity of the project allows it to still be entirely legible to someone unfamiliar with ReactJS

The images are sourced from an API server I hosted on a seperate heroku remote:

## Areas for future improvement

Due to the time contraint, I was not able to implement a swiping function for the images. I was also never truly satisfied with my pagination styling, and would have to experiment more to find something I felt was both unique and functional. I also did not spend my usual amount of time writing tests and focusing on refactoring, a process that I usually find cannot be rushed to arrive at a final form.
