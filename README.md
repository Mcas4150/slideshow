## Design Decisions

I wanted the design of this project to be simple yet attentive. The color palette was inspired by military grey and warning labels. I also  added some slight animation to the buttons, and made the project mobile-friendly

## Development Decisions

The biggest decision of this project was probably choosing to use ReactJS over vanilla javascript. Although the prompt forbid use of libraries, ReactJS was also one of the desired modern framework skills for the position. Since most of my recent work has been in react, its use delivered a better project given the time constraints. However, I believe the project architecture is still entirely readable

The images are sourced from an API server I hosted on a seperate heroku server:

## Areas for future improvement

Due to the time contraint, I was not able to implement a swiping function for the images. I was also never truly satisfied with my pagination styling, and would have to experiment more to find something I felt was both unique and functional. I also did not spend my usual amount of time writing tests and focusing on refactoring, a process that I usually find cannot be rushed to arrive at a final form.
